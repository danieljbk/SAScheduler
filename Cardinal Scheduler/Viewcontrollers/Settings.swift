//This class is used to present the user with the option of changing the first block of the week or the names of their classes. It required a new class because of the X button. The X button is unnecessary, but slight confusion was anticipated when navigating from this viewController due to its minimalistic nature.
class Settings: UIViewController {

    @IBAction func X(_ sender: Any) {
        //The action dismisses the pop-up.
        dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
    }

        super.viewDidLoad()
